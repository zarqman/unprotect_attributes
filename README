Contact: tm@iprog.com

A plugin to add methods to ActiveRecord to modify all attributes, including 
protected ones. This is useful where some attributes are protected for general
user access, but a separate admin controller should be able to update 
everything.


Installation:
  Simply add this plugin into your rails app.

  To add to your rails app:
    ./script/plugin install http://svn.iprog.com/projects/rails/plugins/unprotect_attributes

Methods:
  protected_attributes=(attributes)
    Use just like attributes=.
    Example: @user.protected_attributes = {:role=>'admin'}
  
  update_protected_attributes(attributes) // update_protected_attributes!(attributes)
    Use just like update_attributes and update_attributes!.
    Example: @user.update_protected_attributes :role=>'admin'

Other Notes:
  Tested only with Rails 2.1, although I suspect it will work with 2.0 and 1.2.
  
  If you find a bug, have a suggestion, or just want to tell me that it works,
  I'd love to hear from you.  Thanks for checking unprotect_attributes out!
